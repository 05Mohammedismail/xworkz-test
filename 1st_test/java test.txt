1) java is a command used to execute the program it's location is in 
     C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_261\bin
	 
   javac means java compiler it is also a command used to compile the program
   it's location is in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_261\bin
   
   
2) JDk means "Java development kit" basically its a software platform used to 
    create and develop java programs

   JRE means "Java Runtime Environment" basically it is also a software of JDK
    where we can execute the programs   
	
   JVM means "Java Virtual Machine" Jvm is present inside jre where the actual execution
    is done by jvm but we cannot see it 

3) Limitations of Array are
   1)Array should be used inside the class
   2)Array is defined by "datatype[]" followed by "Array_name"   
   3)After declaring a Array we should always use "{ }"(curly braces) to initialize 
    any value inside array
   4)Array supports both implicit and explicit initialization
   5)Array should be called inside a Main method
   6)Once the Array is defined we cannot change the size of Array
   7)Array values are strored in the form of indexes and the indexing starts from 0
   
4) class is a design or a Blue print for every program we need class 
    after writing class we write methods and variables inside the class 
	Syntax for class declaration is " class Class_Name{}"
	A class is a non-primitive.
	
   Object is a instace of a class , object has State and Method
   
   Signature of method is  "Static void main(String[] args)"  

5) Array is Collection of Same type of Objects it basiclly acts like a container
    and the information filled inside the array is called as "Elements"
   Array is defined by using "[]"
   Syntax of Array declaraion
   "datatype[] Array_name" 
   to initialize array elements we use a pair of Curly braces "{}" inside this 
    we fill the elements of array
   we can initialize a array by both implicit and explixit way

6) .java means its a source code written by the developer 
     it is platform dependent
   
   .class means its a byte code which we produce after the compilation of .java
    .class or byte code is platform independent
    And this byte code makes the whole java language platform independent

7) byte[] data = {12,34,9,0,-62,88} is
     = 6
	 
8) static void method_name(parameter)throws class
    1)In a method signature it contains A non access specifier a return type 
     and a method_name to which we can give parameters
    2)And a parameter is nothing but the variable declaration inside the parenthesis
    3)And we can invoke a method signature only my using main method	

9) Java is High Level object oriented programming language used in majority all over
    the world becouse it is platform independent thta means WORA(Write once runs anywhere)
	and the thing which makes java platform independent is byte code ,we use java to 
	build web management thats why you can find java almost everywhere around you
	even your laptops,mobiles and smart watches are running under java

10) Variables are reference to the address we initialize
    1)variables play a vital role in programming
    2)variable are always defined inside the class
    3)Syntax to declare variable	
	   datatype Variable_name
	4)where the datatype can be primitive or non primitive
	5) we can initialize the variable in both implicit and explicit way
    6) there are 2types of Variables
     1)Instace variable : declared inside the class but outside the method
     2)Local Variable : declared inside the method 
	 
11) A class variable is Defined inside a class to which we cant make any copies of 
     a class variable is not a instance variable

12) A datatype is used to tell about the type of data we are using to
     initialize the variable
    types of datatypes are
    1) primitive : there are 8 Primitive datatypes
      primitive data types are : byte,short,int,long,char,float,double,boolean
    2) non-primitive : A non-primitive datatype is a customised data written by   
                       the developer so number of non-primitive's are infinite

13) Java features are:
    1) simple 
    2) high level language
    3) object oriented
    4) platform independent
    5) secure language

14) Types of Array are
   1)Single dimensional
   2)Multi dimensional

15) Suppose we have written the elements about the length of 5index but if we try to 
    call the element at 6 index then the javac will show the error of index out of bound
    exception

16) System.out.println() is a line written to print the message or a value 
    here system is a pre-defined name
         out is static variable
         println is a static method
		 () is used to insert parameter
		 . is a dot operator used to link the class with the reference 
		 
17) It is used to tell the reference  locating to the  address is whether true or false

18) Dot operator is used to call the member of a method from class

19) SuperClass is a base class from which all other classes are derived

20)1)abstract
   2)assert
   3)byte
   4)boolean
   5)break
   6)char
   7)catch
   8)class
   9)case
   10)continue
   11)double
   11)default
   12)do
   13)enum
   14)extends
   15)else
   16)float
   17)final
   18)finally
   19)for
   20)int
   21)if
   22)instanceof
   23)interface
   24)implements
   25)import
   26)long
   27)null
   28)native
   29)new
   30)package
   31)public
   32)private
   33)protected
   34)return
   35)static
   36)strictfp
   37)synchronize
   38)super
   39)switch
   40)short
   41)throws
   42)throw
   43)try
   44)this
   45)transient
   46)void
   47)volatile
   48)while
